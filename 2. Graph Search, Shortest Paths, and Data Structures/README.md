# Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).

### Week 1

- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Topological Sorting
- Kosaraju Algorithm to compute Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in directed graph

### Week 2

- Dikjstra's Algorithm to compute Single-Source Shortest Paths with non-negative edge lengths

### Week 3

- Binary Heap (insert, min/max)
- Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, min, max, floor, ceil, rank, select)
- Median Maintainance Problem

### Week 4

- Hash Table with separate chaining
- Bloom Filters
- 2 SUM problem using hash table
- 2 SUM problem using binary search
