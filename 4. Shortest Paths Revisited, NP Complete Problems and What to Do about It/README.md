# Shortest Paths Revisited, NP Complete Prolems and What to Do about It

The primary topics in this part of the specialization are: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).

### Week 1

- Bellman-Ford for Single-Source Shortest Paths
- Floyd-Marshall for All-Pair Shortest Paths
- Johnson's Algorithm for All-Pair Shortest Paths

### Week 2

- Vertex Cover Problem
- Travelling Salesman Problem using dynamic programming

### Week 3

- Knapsack Problem using heuristics
- Travelling Salesman Problem using nearest neighbour heuristics

### Week 4

- 2-SAT problem using Kosaraju's SCC algorithm
